                        netskel environment syncrhonizer

INTRODUCTION

netskel is an http(s) based file syncronication tool which can be used to 
mirror a central repository of files to multiple UNIX shell accounts.  It was
built to create a simple and automated mechanism for users to push out their
various shell environment config files to all the machines where they have
shell accounts.

In particular it's useful for pushing out a common .cshrc, .bashrc, or ssh
authorized_keys file to all your hosts.  Using netskel will all you to make
centralized changes and updates to your unix enviornment without suffering
through the tedium of applying those changes to the multitude of hosts where
you have an account.

Multiple users (repositories) can all use the same server.


REQUIREMENTS

The client-side code is written is vanilla bourne shell (/bin/sh) and relies
on as few local binaries as possible.  This means that you can reliably use
netskel not just on your crazy, bleeding-edge, high-zoot, dev-branch Linux 
hosts but also on your "salt of the earth" SunOS and HPUX accounts that
haven't seen new software in a decade.

The server side is implemented in php, but it's quite lightweight and doesn't
need a database or any fancy php modules.  It does expect apache to be set
with AllowOverrides and to have a working mod_rewrite module (see .htaccess).
You'll also need to have this installed on a server which is accessible via
http (proxying should be fine) to all the machines you wish to use as netskel
clients.


INSTALLATION

1. Place these files in a web-accessible directory with a static URL.
2. create a "db" directory.
3. create a directory named after your desired username.  It is not 
   necessary that this username match the unix account name on a client
   machine.
4. Create any files you wish to sync within this ./db/username/ directory.
   For example, mine contains something like this:

   ./db/nugget/.cshrc
   ./db/nugget/.vimrc
   ./db/nugget/.ssh/authorized_keys

5. Make sure the permissions on the db tree allow your web server to read
   them.
